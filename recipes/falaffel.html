        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Soak dried chickpeas</strong>: This step is simple. Add dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans) to a large bowl and cover by quite a few inches of water. Set the bowl aside and let the beans rehydrate until they triple in size. This takes a while, so I do this the night before I plan to make falafel. I’ve also done this two days in advance, drained the beans, and then kept them covered in the fridge.</li>
            <li><strong>Process all falafel ingredients in a food processor</strong> Roughly chop the onion/scallions, and then add them to the food processor with the chickpeas, garlic, herbs, spices, salt, and pepper. Then pulse until the mixture is chopped small, but before it is smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Cover the falafel mix and refrigerate for 15 minutes</strong>: Other recipes call for chilling the falafel mix for 2 hours, since we aren’t using canned chickpeas or flour in our recipe, we only need 15 minutes of chill time.</li>
            <li><strong>Form balls from the falafel mix</strong>: This recipe makes about 18 falafel, so since it’s just the two of us, I usually form half of the mix into balls and then refrigerate the rest for the next day. The mixture might seem like it wants to fall apart, but trust us, it won’t. Just scoop 1 1/2 tablespoons or so of the mix and press it into a ball or oblong shape with the palms of your hands (it’s a little messy, but easy).</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the falafel</strong>: For the most authentic and crispy falafel, we fry the falafel in about 3/4 inch of oil. I’m not usually one to fry foods in my kitchen, but when it comes to falafel, it’s 100% worth it! It’s also not as difficult or messy as many make it seem. I have provided tips for baking and pan-frying falafel below, but remember, for the best falafel, frying is the answer.</li>
